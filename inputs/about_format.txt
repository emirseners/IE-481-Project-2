    The provide graphs are represented as adjacency matrices. They are undirected and 
simple. So, the matrix is symmetric and the diagonal entries are 0. The naming format 
is as follows.

    graph_TYPE_ORDER_DENSITY_ID.txt

    TYPE: Type of the graph. e.g. random, perfect, etc.
    ORDER: Number of vertices
    DENSITY: Approximate edge density after the decimal. "50000" corresponds to a density 
of "0.50".
    ID: An identification number to distinguish between graphs with same type,
order and densities
